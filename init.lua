  --       These are some example plugins that I've included in the kickstart repository.
  --       Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them.
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.autoformat',
  -- require 'kickstart.plugins.debug',

  -- NOTE: The import below can automatically add your own plugins, configuration, etc from `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua`
  --    You can use this folder to prevent any conflicts with this init.lua if you're interested in keeping
  --    up-to-date with whatever is in the kickstart repo.
  --    Uncomment the following line and add your plugins to `lua/custom/plugins/*.lua` to get going.
